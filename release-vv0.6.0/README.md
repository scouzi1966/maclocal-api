# MacLocalAPI is the repo for the afm command on MacOs 26 Tahoe. The afm command (cli) allows one to access the on-device Apple LLM Foundation model from the command line in a single prompt or in API mode. It allows integration with other OS command line tools using standard Unix pipes.

Note: afm command supports trained adapaters using Apple's Toolkit: https://developer.apple.com/apple-intelligence/foundation-models-adapter/

I have also created a wrapper tool to make the training easier on both Macs M series and Linux with CUDA

# The TLDR quick installation of the afm command on MacOS 26 Tahoe:

```bash
# Add the tap (first time only)
brew tap scouzi1966/afm

# Install or upgrade AFM
brew install afm
# OR upgrade existing:
brew upgrade afm

# Verify installation
afm --version  # Should show latest release

# Brew workaround If you are having issues upgrading, Try the following:

brew uninstall afm

brew untap scouzi1966/afm

Try again
```

**HOW TO USE afm:**
```bash

# Start the OpenAI compatible API server on DEFAULT port 9999
afm

# Start the OPenAPI compatible  API server on port 9998 with trained adapter
afm -a ./my_adapater.fmadapter -p 9998

# Use in single mode
afm -i "you are a pirate, you only answer in pirate jargon" -s "Write a story about Einstein"

# Use in single mode with adapater
afm -s "Write a story about Einstein" -a ./my_adapater.fmadapter

# Use in pipe mode
ls -ltr | afm -i "list the files only of ls output"

# Experimental with Apple Vision Framework - extract text
afm vision -f file.jpg or pdf

# Experimental with Apple Vision Framework - detect and extract tables in csv. Can be handwritten text and it will use OCR
afm vision -t -f file.jpg or pdf 
```

A very simple to use macOS server application that exposes Apple's Foundation Models through OpenAI-compatible API endpoints. Run Apple Intelligence locally with full OpenAI API compatibility. For use with Python, JS or even open-webui (https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui).

With the same command, it also supports single mode to interact the model without starting the server. In this mode, you can pipe with any other command line based utilities. 

As a bonus, both modes allows the use of using a LoRA adapter, trained with Apple's toolkit. This allows to quickly test them without having to integrate them in your app or involve xCode.

The magic command is afm

    model="foundation",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"}

### JavaScript/Node.js

```javascript
import OpenAI from 'openai';

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: 'not-needed-for-local',
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:9999/v1',
});

const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Write a haiku about programming' }],
  model: 'foundation',
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```

### curl Examples

```bash
# Basic chat completion
curl -X POST http://localhost:9999/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "foundation",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
    ]
  }'

# With temperature control

## üîß Configuration

### Command Line Options

```bash
OVERVIEW: macOS server that exposes Apple's Foundation Models through OpenAI-compatible API

USAGE: afm [--port <port>] [--verbose] [--no-streaming] [--instructions <instructions>] [--single-prompt <single-prompt>]

OPTIONS:
  -p, --port <port>       Port to run the server on (default: 9999)
  -v, --verbose           Enable verbose logging
  --no-streaming          Disable streaming responses (streaming is enabled by default)
  -i, --instructions <instructions>
                          Custom instructions for the AI assistant (default: You are a helpful assistant)
  -s, --single-prompt <single-prompt>
                          Run a single prompt without starting the server
  --version               Show the version.
  -h, --help              Show help information.

Note: afm also accepts piped input from other commands, equivalent to using -s with the piped content as the prompt.

```

### Environment Variables

The server respects standard logging environment variables:
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Set logging level (trace, debug, info, notice, warning, error, critical)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Notes

- **Model Scope**: Uses Apple's 3B parameter Foundation Model (optimized for on-device performance)
- **No Streaming**: Current implementation doesn't support streaming responses
- **macOS 26+ Only**: Requires the latest macOS with Foundation Models framework
- **Apple Intelligence Required**: Must be enabled in System Settings
- **Token Estimation**: Uses word-based approximation for token counting

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Foundation Models framework is not available"
1. Ensure you're running **macOS 26 Beta 5** or later
2. Enable **Apple Intelligence** in System Settings ‚Üí Apple Intelligence & Siri
3. Verify you're on an **Apple Silicon Mac**
4. Restart the application after enabling Apple Intelligence

### Server Won't Start
1. Check if the port is already in use: `lsof -i :9999`
2. Try a different port: `./MacLocalAPI --port 8080`
3. Enable verbose logging: `./MacLocalAPI --verbose`

### Build Issues
1. Ensure you have **Xcode 26 beta 5** installed
2. Update Swift toolchain: `xcode-select --install`
3. Clean and rebuild: `swift package clean && swift build -c release`
